There's a pretty good reason, if you look back I talked about error. Well if you imagine any observation is made up of something we wanted to observe, and elements we did not want to observe, yet observed by mistake (error). Now it may not be known what we wanted to observe or how it relates to what we actually did observe, but that's okay. One mistake we can make, however, is to assume that our observation is entirely useful. When we do that, we have observed noise and interpreted it as signal. I said elements we observed by mistake because sometimes noise can actually be useful information, just not by our current observation. For example, if I wanted to determine the speed of a motor powering a saw in a saw mill and I decided I would use rough calculations based on computer vision from a feed of logs approaching the saw. Well I might find that it's sometimes hard to see the logs through the camera because too much sawdust is in the way, and I might consider that noise. However, if I was clever I might use the amount of the field of view obstructed by sawdust as my signal, and then it isn't noise at all. Just like quantum mechanics, it's all a matter of perspective. </p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="42"><p>So anyway, overfitting is just assuming that all of our information is signal; by dint, listening to the noise. It's not good. However, overfitting is not a necessary byproduct of complex models - a perfect model may just be complex. Essentially, we can assume that 100% of our information is not strictly useful and that some portion of it probably is (unless we completely do not understand the topic). It seems really strange to me that overfitting is pushed over and over again without really explaining the weakness of complexity. Every component has a nonzero chance of failure and stacking up components eventually leads to a near certainty of failure in the system as a whole. The machine learning model works the same way, except each component in this case is a piece of the data and some tool, and there's probably a diminishing significance in the data. </p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-v_Column-b6772743-c17e-4e03-9146-9f10b87e4106" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-medium p-0 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="43"><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-1 " data-reactid="44"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 max-w-768px m-a" data-reactid="45"><!-- react-empty: 46 --><!-- react-empty: 47 --><!-- react-empty: 48 --><!-- react-empty: 49 --><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="50"><p>Now I'm a pretty big fan of control systems which for some reason hasn't collided with machine learning to be absorbed into a general field of study. Basically, they are nearly the same. Anyway, what control theory teaches us is there's this thing called error, and that's what we learn from. People have all sorts of cute expressions to analogize this to life experience, but the point of the matter is: error is extremely important.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="51"><p>No error means no learning. Now, there are a bunch of different kinds of error, but a good way to think of it is that error is anything we cannot yet explain. Think of it this way, if we can explain everything there is nothing to learn. Philosophically this is pretty cool, so let's look at something unknowable like dice. Dice are pretty random in a truly random sort of way. Now suppose we had something that would predict which side a die would land on, there's no way we could possibly guess which side right? So assuming a six sided die we could only expect to get this right 1/6th of the time. Wrong, it's only unknowable if that's all the information you have. Imagine we have high-speed cameras all over the inside of a box and we look at the frames milliseconds before the die settles, can it then predict what side a die will land on 1 millisecond before it comes to rest? Of course it can (with perhaps some error)! So while it may be impossible with as vague of a notion as "I'm going to roll a die," that's only because there's not enough data to make a prediction. In this case some error may be irreducible (totally unknowable ever), but given the right information like which side is up 1 millisecond before settling, it's not that hard. So this error is actually a sum of many knowable and unknowable errors. Knowing absolutely nothing about a coin toss, we can predict the outcome only 50% of the time; however, knowing absolutely everything about the coin toss our accuracy can approach infinity. </p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-v_Column-800e5162-c70e-4961-abd7-392a35595b8d" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-medium p-0 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="52"><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-1 " data-reactid="53"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 max-w-768px m-a" data-reactid="54"><!-- react-empty: 55 --><!-- react-empty: 56 --><!-- react-empty: 57 --><!-- react-empty: 58 --><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="59"><p>So it seems like at first what we learn from machine learning is: things are correlated.

This deep epistemological question doesn't actually seem to really have an answer. We can fool ourselves into believing we have learned and we can create useful models, but there isn't anyway to know for sure that we have actually learned. A lot of people never really internalize this but it's pretty important. However, in order for this entire field, and most of humanity, to make sense we really need this assumption to hold - so let's assume it does. How do we know we've learned? Well basically - we see if we we get better at things based on past performance. It's really that easy. </p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-v_Column2x-db6822d2-e247-43e2-87bb-396aa1d63586" class="Section Section--components-2 color-title title-size-medium  color-bg text-align-left  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="61"><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-2 " data-reactid="62"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px max-w-768px p-1" data-reactid="63"><!-- react-empty: 64 --><!-- react-empty: 65 --><!-- react-empty: 66 --><!-- react-empty: 67 --><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="68"><p>So recently I started taking the Machine Learning NanoDegree from Udacity, and I think it's pretty cool.

Well I might find that it's sometimes hard to see the logs through the camera because too much sawdust is in the way, and I might consider that noise. However, if I was clever I might use the amount of the field of view obstructed by sawdust as my signal, and then it isn't noise at all.
