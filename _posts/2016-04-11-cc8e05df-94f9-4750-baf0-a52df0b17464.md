Websites: Far from a solved problem. I love websites but it's so hard to make one. Mostly just because it's hard to maintain a website. I imagine the same problem exists for books and other large projects. Single Piece Flow is usually the best strategy for making something with as little waste as possible, but a large body of work that continues to expand for days or weeks is difficult to make "single piece".
