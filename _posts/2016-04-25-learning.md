description: "So recently I started taking the Machine Learning NanoDegree from Udacity, and I think it's pretty cool. Unfortunately for me I've read a whole lot about machine learning (and learning in general) in the past so a lot of it feels like things I've heard over and over again. This, I guess, is the value of actually going to school for something, you have the confidence of having actually been certified to know something, even if the value of that certification is unreliable - at least it exists. Hence, I'm taking a nanodegree; that way I'll have some certification that I know some things and maybe then I can get a start and my projects will then speak for themselves."
