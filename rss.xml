            <title><![CDATA[Machine Learning - part 2]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Now I'm a pretty big fan of control systems which for some reason hasn't collided with machine learning to be absorbed into a general field of study. Basically, they are nearly the same. Anyway, what control theory teaches us is there's this thing called error, and that's what we learn from. People have all sorts of cute expressions to analogize this to life experience, but the point of the matter is: error is extremely important.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>So it seems like at first what we learn from machine learning is: things are correlated. Crazytown I know, but yes there are things we want to know and those things are, in fact, often related to things we already know or can know. </p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>So recently I started taking the Machine Learning NanoDegree from Udacity, and I think it's pretty cool. Unfortunately for me I've read a whole lot about machine learning (and learning in general) in the past so a lot of it feels like things I've heard over and over again. This, I guess, is the value of actually going to school for something, you have the confidence of having actually been certified to know something, even if the value of that certification is unreliable - at least it exists. Hence, I'm taking a nanodegree; that way I'll have some certification that I know some things and maybe then I can get a start and my projects will then speak for themselves.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Websites: Far from a solved problem. I love websites but it's so hard to make one. Mostly just because it's hard to maintain a website. I imagine the same problem exists for books and other large projects. Single Piece Flow is usually the best strategy for making something with as little waste as possible, but a large body of work that continues to expand for days or weeks is difficult to make "single piece".Â </p>]]></description>
